+ [EPILEPSY WARNING (MAYBE?)]
    This game may briefly contain a high-contrast shift in full-screen background colour at a rate of 1 HZ for about 3 seconds.
    <br>
    This is not within the 3 - 55 HZ range that some online guidelines say to avoid, but I figured I should let you know, just in case.
