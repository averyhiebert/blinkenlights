# IDEAS

## Story premise
 - Player is test subject, stuff starts going wrong/sinister (portal-like)

## Technical stuff
 - detect left/right wink for binary story choices?
 - visual depiction of blinking for streamer-mode
 - warning about facecam for streamer-mode



## Puzzle/level ideas
(Sorted roughly according to how easy to implement)
 - blinking changes subtle details of the environment
 - blinking changes environment drastically (e.g. day/night)
 - room fills up with water the more you blink
 - ask player to close eyes for a set amount of time
    - good for intro
 - blinking blacks out the screen and it slowly fades in
 - puzzle that resets itself if you blink, so you have to finish the whole thing without blinking
 - blinking automatically triggers choices
 - information only appears on screen when blinking, need to fake/squint to see it.
 - gorgon (can't look at it or it attacks)
    - need to use your phone or squint or something.
    - or we can use "left" and "right" side of screen as big targets, and make you carry out a sequence of moves with your eyes closed?
    - fits with a labyrinth theme, forking left/right.
 - weeping angel
    - best as a finale
    - close the browser tab if player dies?
 - environment is unstable if you keep eyes *open* for too long.
    - then, once player is used to this, punish them for blinking again!
 - synchronized blinking
 - jumpscare player with their own face (get image from JS)
 - staring contest with your own eye-shapes (get shapes from JS)
    - then the eyes start to rotate/tilt slightly, but of course if you tilt your head to the same time to match it'll cause them to tilt even further in response to your own movement.
    - idk, maybe I'm too sleep deprived to come up with non-silly ideas.
